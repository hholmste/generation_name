# generation_name
creating names using markov-chains.

two scripts: build-lang takes a list of words and an ordinal and generates some sort of markov-chain-like thing. generate_name takes a file containing the results from build-lang and generates a new word. I can generate many words.

todo: fix stupid naming.
